#THIS PROJECT IS NON-FUNCTIONAL

Notes from the developer:

    This project has been designed to be an easy to use way to create a setup sheet for a Chick-Fil-A kitchen, I no longer work at CFA but thought that this would have been a useful tool to build for myself
at the time I worked there, please note that in its current state the project is non functional and I have uploaded it as an atempt to learn GIT while I get into software development. 

Currently Working on:

    The core focus of my efforts at this point are to create a way to store and manage Team Members and their related atributes - ideally then the program would cross refrence the database with the userinput to make sure each teammember was documented in the system. 

    This further down the line would create the framework for a sorting alogrithm to assign a set of Team Members to a position that suits them best in the scope of the Teams's performance.

Known Issues:
    The path for the location of the data is a static string, I don't currently know how to build a path for a file, and as its further down the list of what I would need to get it running at the bare minimum I havent fixed this yet. 

    Two of the same name being input will cause the program to crash.
