#THIS PROJECT IS BUGGY
#MY FIRST COMPLETED PROJECT!

Notes from the developer:

    This project has been designed to be an easy to use way to create a setup sheet for a Chick-Fil-A kitchen, I no longer work at CFA but thought that this would have been a useful tool to build for myself at the time I worked there, please note that in its current state the project is non functional and I have uploaded it as an atempt to learn GIT while I get into software development. 

Currently Working on:

    The Project is currently complete - I have been able to diagnose issues in my own code that I would like to fix so I am off to the next project to focus on a set of different skills I want to foster. 
    This are exception handling, better use of data in an object, better encapsulation, learning about inheritence and maximizing the use I get from switch cases. I also believe that creating more flexible functions will help me in the future as my projects grow. 

Known Issues:
    The path for the location of the data is a static string, it works for my use case but wont unless you set its path specifically for your local machine in the LocalMenus class.

    Two of the same name being input will cause the program to crash. I have no expection or check for this, but I might come back later as I do have an idea on how to fix this with a hash table.
